  "description": "### Update Notes\n\nVersion 29 has some new bout specific features.  These could be helpful for daily fantasy contests.  These features are missing for the most recent events.  That will be fixed soon.  The new features are:\n\n`R_kd_bout`\t\n`B_kd_bout`\t\n`R_sig_str_landed_bout`\t\n`B_sig_str_landed_bout`\t\n`R_sig_str_attempted_bout`\t\n`B_sig_str_attempted_bout`\t\n`R_sig_str_pct_bout`\t\n`B_sig_str_pct_bout`\t\n`R_tot_str_landed_bout`\t\n`B_tot_str_landed_bout`\t\n`R_tot_str_attempted_bout`\t\n`B_tot_str_attempted_bout`\t\n`R_td_landed_bout`\t\n`B_td_landed_bout`\t\n`R_td_attempted_bout`\t\n`B_td_attempted_bout`\t\n`R_td_pct_bout`\t\n`B_td_pct_bout`\t\n`R_sub_attempts_bout`\t\n`B_sub_attempts_bout`\t\n`R_pass_bout`\t\n`B_pass_bout`\t\n`R_rev_bout`\t\n`B_rev_bout`\n\n\nVersion 22 now contains information about when the fight ended.  This information could be used to predict the length of future fights.\n`finish_round`: The round the fight ended\n`finish_round_time`: Time in the round of the finish\n`total_fight_time_secs`: Total time of the fight in seconds\nIf you're interested in how I did this you can poke around [here](https://github.com/shortlikeafox/tiger-millionaire/blob/master/scrape_all_events/create_time_dataframe.py).\n\n\nDue to popular demand Version 15 (and above) now has two columns that detail how a fight finished.  `finish` is the broad category of the finish.  `finish_details` is more detailed information if available at ufcstats.com.  Combined with the `Winner` column this could be used to predict not only who will win but how.\n\n### Road Map\n\nBefore moving forward my next step will be to fill in the features I have, and just do some general cleaning up of the dataset.  This includes making sure the new bout specific features are being updated properly.  I will also take a look at why there are so many of these new features missing from the original scrape of completed fights.  Hopefully I can fill a lot of these in.  After that I plan on turning my focus to exotic bets.\n\n### Context\n\nThere are some great UFC datasets available on Kaggle.  I want to bring together all of those sets into one set to allow for deeper analysis.  \n\n\n### Upcoming Event\n\nupcoming-event.csv has features for the next upcoming UFC event.\n\n\n### Content\n\nThis dataset includes:\n[Rajeev Warrier's excellent dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/rajeevw/ufcdata).  This dataset was the basis for my work.  It contains data for every UFC bout.  The 'red fighter' and 'blue fighter' are improperly recorded prior to around 2010, so that data has been excluded.  Additionally, features that could not be easily scraped by me for future fights have been removed.\n\n[My odds dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mdabbert/ufc-fights-2010-2020-with-betting-odds).  My big contribution was the gambling odds for each fight.\n\n[Mart J\u00fcrisoo's Rankings dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/martj42/ufc-rankings).  Includes a history of UFC fighter rankings.  A wonderful resource that could have a lot of implications for machine learning models.\n\nThere are 108 columns of data.  I have included a detailed description to the data file.\n\n### Additions to the Datasets\n\nI have created some new features for this dataset.  Highlights include a set of differential features \\[age\\_dif, avg\\_td\\_dif, reach\\_dif....\\] that are the blue fighter's feature minus the red fighter's feature.  The feature 'empty_arena' denotes whether the fights occurred in an empty arena.\n\n\n### Update Schedule\n\nI plan on uploading a file of upcoming fights before every event and updating the main csv after every event.\n\n### Column Descriptions\n`R_fighter`, `B_fighter`: Fighter names\n`R_odds`, `B_odds`: The American odds that the fighter will win.

Sorry for the lack of documentation.  I'll get around to it!\n\nI just scraped all UFC events from ufcstats.com.  You can find it [here](https://github.com/shortlikeafox/tiger-millionaire/tree/master/scrape_all_events/event_webpages).  Please use it for any project you see fit!\n",
